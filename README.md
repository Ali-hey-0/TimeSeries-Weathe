# TimeSeries-Weathe

A robust and modular application for analyzing, forecasting, and visualizing weather time series data. This project leverages modern Python libraries for data manipulation, statistical analysis, time series forecasting, and interactive visualization.

---

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Load weather data from CSV or API sources.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, transform, and engineer time series features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
- **Forecasting Models:** Compare ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and other models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Automated metrics and cross-validation for model performance.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Use Plotly and Dash for live dashboards and visual insights.
- **Extensible Pipeline:** Modular codebase for adding custom models or data sources.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas** — Data manipulation & preprocessing
- **NumPy** — Numerical operations
- **scikit-learn** — Machine learning utilities
- **statsmodels** — Statistical & ARIMA modeling
- **fbprophet/Prophet** — Forecasting with trend/seasonality
- **TensorFlow / Keras** — Deep learning (LSTM/RNN)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** — Static visualization
- **Plotly & Dash** — Interactive dashboards
- **Jupyter Notebook** — Exploratory analysis

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ali-hey-0/TimeSeries-Weathe.git
cd TimeSeries-Weathe
```

### 2. Install dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare your data

- Place your CSV weather time series data in the `data/` directory.
- Ensure your file has a datetime column and at least one numeric weather variable (e.g., temperature, humidity).

### 4. Run the analysis

You can start with the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or execute the main pipeline script (if available):

```bash
python main.py --input data/your_file.csv --target_column temperature
```

## Usage Example

Here’s a minimal code example to load, preprocess, and forecast:

```python
from src.data_loader import load_weather_data
from src.preprocessing import preprocess_data
from src.models.arima_model import train_arima, forecast_arima

# Load and preprocess
df = load_weather_data('data/weather.csv')
df_clean = preprocess_data(df, target_column='temperature')

# Train ARIMA model
model = train_arima(df_clean['temperature'])
forecast = forecast_arima(model, steps=7)

print(forecast)
```

## Model Comparison

- **ARIMA:** Classical approach for stationary data.
- **Prophet:** Handles trend/seasonality, robust to missing data.
- **LSTM:** Deep learning for complex temporal dynamics.

You can compare models interactively in the provided notebooks.

---

## Visualization

- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Static plots for EDA.
- **Plotly/Dash:** Interactive trend, anomaly, and forecast dashboards.
